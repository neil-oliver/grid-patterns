# Grid Patterns
A Level teaching aid based on looped grid based animation.

Grid pattern starts at random layout and then squares randomly changes until a pattern is achieved. No square will change twice before a pattern is achieved. Once a pattern is acheived, the squares will randomly change until a new pattern is acheived and so on.
